            <p>Dear Tazeen Ma'am,</p>
            <p>I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for all your guidance and support throughout the year. You have been an inspiration to me, and I'm grateful to have you as my teacher.</p>
            <p>Here's a beautiful quote for you:</p>
            <blockquote>"A good teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others."</blockquote>
